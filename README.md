# LL-Pengfei-Leetcode-Solutions
Starting from Oct 28th, 2019, the author has posted his own solutions to Leetcode problems in this repository. Please feel free to inform him via his email (zhao.pengfei@comp.nus.edu.sg) if you identify any bugs. All the code in this repo, currently written in cpp/gnu++11, are (reasonably good, hopyfully :) solutions to the Leetcode questions accessible without subscription, and you are free to copy, adapt, or use the code. The author will be thankful if you cite him (Mr. Zhao Pengfei, GitHub: [LL-Pengfei](https://github.com/LL-Pengfei); email: zhao.pengfei@comp.nus.edu.sg) when you use the code in this repo. The author may further extend the current solution pool to include implementations of solutions in different standards/other languages in the future (cpp/gnu++17, java/java8, py/python3, ml/ocaml, etc.). This repo will be updated bi-weekly to monthly, depending on the author's availability.
